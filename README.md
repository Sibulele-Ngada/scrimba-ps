# Personal Site

This project is part of the Web Dev basics module in the Frontend Developer Career Path.

It is originally intended as an introduction to JavaScript. Though not the focus of the lesson, learners are assigned with changing the arguments of function calls to change how data is displayed on screen. It is purely a demonstration of how changing values in JavaScript has a direct effect on your site.

To practice, I have recreated it using React and TypeScript. I have tried to remain true to the spirit of this being a beginner project and I have made my code as explicit as possible.

Visually, I have modified the project by the following:

- Centered content using flexbox
- Added site settings section with dropdowns

The site settings are stored in state and modify the very same functions in the original project
